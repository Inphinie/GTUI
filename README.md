# Grand Unified Theory of Information (GTUI) 💎

**The Algorithmic Ontology of Physical Reality: An Evidence-Based Synthesis.**

## 🌌 Overview

GTUI is not just another speculative "Theory of Everything." It is a bottom-up, evidence-based framework that posits **information is the fundamental substance of the universe**, while particles, spacetime, and forces are emergent algorithmic patterns.

While traditional physics views matter as containing information, GTUI proves—through the synthesis of six independent, peer-reviewed observations—that **the universe is made of information that appears as matter.**

## 🏛 The Six Pillars of Evidence

This repository centralizes the mathematical and experimental evidence supporting the GTUI framework:

| Pillar | Discovery | Core Insight |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1. Fisher Information** | Frieden (1998) | Quantum equations (Schrödinger, Dirac) derive from statistical inference. |
| **2. Quantum Cellular Automata** | D'Ariano (2014) | Discrete algorithmic processing at the Planck scale reproduces relativistic field theory. |
| **3. Entropic Gravity** | Verlinde (2010) | Gravity is not a force but a thermodynamic consequence of information density. |
| **4. Information Mass** | Vopson (2019) | Information has measurable physical mass via the Mass-Energy-Information equivalence. |
| **5. G Variations** | Anderson (2015) | Systematic discrepancies in  suggest vacuum is an informational medium with phases. |
| **6. Black Hole Fluids** | Kubizňák (2012) | Black holes exhibit exact thermodynamic isomorphism with molecular fluids. |

## ⚡ The  Formalism

At the heart of GTUI is the **Compression Parameter **, a dimensionless measure of information density ().

The framework unifies the mass hierarchy through the power-law relation:


This formula explains the **Koide ratio** for leptons and provides a mechanism for calculating particle masses from first principles of algorithmic depth and information conservation.

## 🧪 Experimental Roadmap (2026-2030)

Unlike string theory, GTUI is **falsifiable now**. We propose three primary tests:

1. **Structure-Dependent Gravity:** Measuring  between monocrystalline (diamond) and amorphous (glassy carbon) materials. (Predicted:  ppm).
2. **Information Mass Measurement:** Using nano-mechanical resonators to detect the mass of 1 Terabit of stored data. (Predicted:  kg).
3. **Dark Matter as Information:** Identifying WIMPs in the  GeV range, corresponding to vacuum information at .
